Dynamic Difficulty adjustment aided by Reinforcement Learning in Strategy games.

# TODO List

- Set up .yaml config file for Agent - 0.5 : Done by the 23rd Feb
- Set up rewards and punishments for score - 0.5-1 : Done by the 23rd Feb
- Set up tensor board and such for agent monitoring - 1 : Done by the 23rd Feb
- Decide on what RL agent/SM agent data during training would be best for the DDA system - 2-4 : Done by the 2nd March
- Implement logging and data gathering for DDA system in training scene - 1-2 : Done by the 2nd March
- Ensure that everything is ready for training, monitoring, extraction. Then make evaluation scene. - 1-2 : Done by the 2nd March
- Everything is ready to train the RL Agent. Expected training duration needed (maximum) - 30 hours, split across 3 weeks. : Start by the 3rd March. End by 23rd March latest
- DDA system should not take longer than 2-3 weeks to develop and implement, and final testing of the prototype and data collection scripts added by end of 2nd week of April, with end of April being the absolute limit if things go poorly. Goal is to allow 2-3 weeks in april and may for assignments, and cleaning up/finalising the earlier parts of the paper, and leaving 3 weeks for evaluation, conclusion and abstract.


- Fix sfx so it stops while not grounded.
