# TODO List

- Gather the necessary Unity Assets - Effort : 1-2
    - Very simple character models - Mon-Tue - Done
    - Animations - Mon-Tue - Done (i think)
    - Icons for ores and food - Sun 50/50

    - Terrain materials - Mon-Tue - Done
    - Trees and food materials - Wed - 50/50/done
    - ores - Wed
    - pickaxe or other mining equipment - Wed - Done

- Create the 2 terrains with a dividing clear but visible wall separating the player from the state machine - Effort : 0.5 - Mon

- Create the player moving script with a 3rd person locked top down perspective (or follow camera if time allows), including animations - Effort : 2-3 - Mon-Tue

- Create the score and hunger gamedata - Effort : 0.5 - TODO if it needs to be separate and not like the previous one

- Add mining - Effort : 1-1.5 (raycasts to prevent mining when there is nothing) - Wed

- Add the difficulty and main menu screens - Effort : 0.5-1 - Thur

- Add simple PCG content that spawns the ores pseudo-randomly, and adds more ores and food when a certain amount are used - Effort : 2-3 Thur-Fri

- Create the state machine, and make it where when the difficulty is harder, the player gets less resources and thus must be more efficient - Effort : 2-4 Sat-Sun(January)
